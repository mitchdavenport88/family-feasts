# Family Feasts

### Milestone Project Three
Family Feasts is a cooking E-book that aims to build a library of recipes that will inspire households and families to get off the couch and into the kitchen to cook together! Any member of the family will be able to browse, search and follow recipes that have been posted up by the online community. Users will be encouraged to join the community by signing up and sharing their family favourites to encourage others to cook and spend time with their loved ones.

## Demo
The live site can be viewed here - [Family Feasts](). <!-- add link when deployed -->

## UX
### Strategy
The aim is to create a simple, user friendly recipe e-book using the functionality of creating, reading, updating and deleting data objects. The site is aimed at families or households to encourage them to cook together so must be suitable for all ages.

Any user will be able to view entries that have been uploaded to the platform. They will also be able to filter and search for recipes by using keywords or ingredients. Registered users will also be able to create, edit and delete their own recipes in addition and be able to view their uploaded recipes on their own personal profile page. The site’s admin will have all these privileges along with the ability to edit and delete other user’s entries along with being able to add further categories.

### User Stories
As a first time user I'd like:
* To access and view all recipes.
* To be able to browse by recipe category.
* Information on each recipe to be presented in a clear and concise manner.
* To search for suitable recipes by using keywords or ingredients.
* To sign up to the community easily.
* The site to be easy to navigate around and user friendly.
* To do all of the above regardless of what device I’m using.

As a returning user I'd like:
* To login and logout easily.
* To be able to create and post new recipes to the site.
* Access to my own personal profile where I can view my posted recipes.
* The ability to edit and delete my recipes.
* Feedback when I’m interacting with the site and when inputting data.

As the site owner / admin, I'd want:
* The ability to edit and delete any recipes regardless of who posted it.
* The ability to remove user profiles if needed.
* To be able to add new categories and edit and delete existing ones.
